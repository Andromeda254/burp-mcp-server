# Real-time Scan Progress Monitoring Demo

This document demonstrates the new real-time scan progress monitoring capabilities added to the Burp MCP Server.

## 🌟 New Features

### 1. Real-time Progress Tracking
- **Live progress updates** with percentage completion
- **Status monitoring** (queued, crawling, running, completed)
- **Performance metrics** (requests sent, elapsed time, ETA)

### 2. Vulnerability Discovery Notifications
- **Real-time alerts** when vulnerabilities are discovered
- **Severity classification** (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
- **Detailed evidence** and proof-of-concept data

### 3. Enhanced User Experience
- **Progress bars** with visual completion indicators
- **Time estimates** for remaining scan duration
- **Event history** with full audit trail

## 🚀 New MCP Tool: `get_scan_progress`

### Usage Examples

#### 1. Monitor All Active Scans
```json
{
  "name": "get_scan_progress",
  "arguments": {}
}
```

#### 2. Monitor Specific Scan with History
```json
{
  "name": "get_scan_progress", 
  "arguments": {
    "taskId": "scan-abc-123",
    "includeHistory": true,
    "format": "detailed"
  }
}
```

#### 3. Get Summary View
```json
{
  "name": "get_scan_progress",
  "arguments": {
    "format": "summary"
  }
}
```

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Key Components

1. **ScanProgressMonitor** - Core progress tracking system
   - Thread-safe concurrent operations
   - Event history with cleanup
   - Real-time subscriber notifications

2. **Enhanced BurpIntegration** - Integrated monitoring
   - Progress updates during scan phases
   - Vulnerability discovery notifications
   - Realistic mock scanning with timing

3. **Progress Event System** - Event-driven architecture
   - Real-time progress updates
   - Vulnerability notifications
   - Heartbeat monitoring
   - Completion notifications

### Event Types

- **SCAN_STARTED** - Scan initiated and queued
- **PROGRESS_UPDATE** - Regular progress updates
- **VULNERABILITY_FOUND** - Real-time vulnerability discovery
- **SCAN_COMPLETED** - Scan finished successfully
- **HEARTBEAT** - Keep-alive for long-running scans

## 📈 Usage with Claude Desktop

### Starting a Scan with Progress Monitoring
```
"Please start a comprehensive security scan on https://example.com and show me the real-time progress"
```

### Monitoring Active Scans
```
"Show me the current progress of all active security scans"
```

### Getting Detailed Progress with History
```
"Get detailed progress information for scan task abc12345 including the event history"
```

### Checking for New Vulnerabilities
```
"Are there any new vulnerabilities discovered in the running scans?"
```

## 🎯 Benefits

### For Security Professionals
- **Real-time visibility** into scan progress
- **Immediate vulnerability notifications** 
- **Professional progress tracking** with ETA
- **Complete audit trail** of scan events

### For Development Teams
- **Better scan scheduling** with accurate timing
- **Early vulnerability detection** during CI/CD
- **Progress monitoring** for long-running scans
- **Enhanced user experience** with live updates

### For Automation
- **Event-driven workflows** based on progress
- **Integration points** for external monitoring
- **Scalable architecture** for multiple concurrent scans
- **Clean API** for custom progress consumers

## 🔄 Future Enhancements

The progress monitoring system is designed for extensibility:

- **WebSocket/SSE server** for web dashboards
- **Progress webhooks** for external integrations
- **Custom progress thresholds** and alerts
- **Historical progress analytics** and reporting
- **Multi-tenant progress isolation**

This real-time monitoring capability transforms the Burp MCP Server from a simple tool interface into a comprehensive security testing platform with enterprise-grade progress visibility.
